# Lessons Learned
I ran into some issues while setting up react native on my laptop and after the lesson about expo I tried setting that up and realized that expo takes less than 2 minutes to set up compared to the couple weeks I spent on normal react native. 
Going into the project I already had a lot of experience with React.js so I thought that it would be really similar and thus be a really simple few hours of work. But I was kinda wrong in that there were a lot of small differences mainly in how components are used so I spent a day or two learning how all of that worked together. 
Along the way I learned that expo has its drawbacks too in that a lot of custom packages don't work very well with it or didn't work at all. I found this out when I tried importing some custom date picker components and none of them were working. But eventually I was able to find one that did work and used that one instead: @dietime/react-native-date-picker.
Overall, it was a really fun project as I already knew how basic react works as well as hooks but I got to learn a slightly different way of developing a "web"/mobile app and got to practice using react more again which will be really useful in the future!
